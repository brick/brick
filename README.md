Incubator for PHP components under development.

Once a component reaches sufficient maturity, it will be moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/brick)
and composer package, and enter a beta phase. For this reason, this repository will never contain releases.

The incubator can be included in your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
Just define the following requirement in your `composer.json` file:

    {
        "require": {
            "brick/brick": "dev-master"
        }
    }

Feel free to use the incubator for your own use/research, but please note that the API can, and will,
change at any time. Components can also disappear at any time.

This does not mean that you cannot use this repository in your project if you find it useful;
just be sure to lock Composer to the specific version your code is written for:

    {
        "require": {
            "brick/brick": "dev-master#f68f91a5a80c6dc4a91923800e5eaf5acbd1314b"
        }
    }

Or just avoid blind `composer update` runs once your `composer.lock` file has been written.
Update individual components instead when required, and only update `brick/brick` if needed.
